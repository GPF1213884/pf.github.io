<h1>Self Introduction</h1>

<p>My name is 郭沛枫(Sichuan boy),which was named by my uncle.And it's been 18 years since I came to this lovely world.
(But my first month to embrace this fascinating and "hair costing" programming/doge//doge/)</p>

<p>As for my hobbies ,I think.....of course studying(haha). For my specialities,I'm confident because I can dance(Latin)and play the violin.
 However,I'm regretful my not keeping dancing and not turning violin a real speciality(my bow on the violin is just like a knife on a chicken's or a duck's neck for they both make the same noise.)</p>

<h1> My Life </h1>

<p>Now,let's wind back the clock to see my short life.</p>

 <p>Even if it was not allowed,our family still had the second child---me.So I surely have a brother or sister.Brother or sister?The answer will show as you scroll your mouse.</p>

<p>As time passed, as many "wisers" said:the older a girl is ,the more beautiful she will be,but boys are quite contrary to that,I am not an exception.But my pupil time may be the most glorious time for 18 years.Yet a hero is silent about his past glories.I don't know why but the truth is that I began to be withdrawn from that time.</p>

<p>The next page of my life comes to be "dark".When I got to middle school,I'v done nearly all the things bad students do,such as eating snacks on EVERY Chinese class and copying(real copy with a printer)others' homework.What my teacher expected was that I just can get into high school nor into a nice school and a best class.</p>
