<h1>Self Introduction</h1>

<p>My name is 郭沛枫(Sichuan boy),which was named by my uncle.And it's been 18 years since I came to this lovely world.
(But my first month to embrace this fascinating and "hair costing" programming/doge//doge/)</p>

<p>As for my hobbies ,I think.....of course studying(haha). For my specialities,I'm confident because I can dance(Latin)and play the violin.
 However,I'm regretful my not keeping dancing and not turning violin a real speciality(my bow on the violin is just like a knife on a chicken's or a duck's neck for they both make the same noise.)</p>

<h1> My Life </h1>
