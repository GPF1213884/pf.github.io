<p>Self Introduction<p>

<p>My name is 郭沛枫(Sichuan boy),which was named by my uncle.And it's been 18 years since I came to this lovely world.
(But my first month to embrace this fascinating and "hear costing" programming/doge//doge/)</p>
<p>As for my hobbies ,I think.....of course studying(haha). For my spcialities,I'm confident because I can dance(Latin)and play the violin.
 However,I'm regretful my not keeping will make the same noise.</p>
<h1> My Life </h1>
<p>Now,let's wind back the clock to see me growing up.</p>
